      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Eddie the Eagle Edwards:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1963</strong> - Edwards was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. His family calls him by his given name, Michael. "Eddie" is a nickname derived by schoolfriends from his surname. After a taste of skiing on a school trip aged 13, he developed his skills on dry slopes, then worked for a season at Glenshee in Scotland.</li>
        <li>

          <strong>1987</strong> - Edwards first represented Great Britain at the 1987 World Championships in Oberstdorf in Bavaria, West Germany, and was ranked 55th in the world.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1988</strong> - During the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary Edwards competed in and finished last in both the 70 m and 90 m events.
        </li>

        <li id="vi">
          <strong>Victory</strong>- Edwards' jump of 71 m at Calgary in the Winter Olympics was then a British record (now 134.50 m held by Halifax-born Sam Bolton). His Olympic jump still puts him sixth on the all-time list of British ski jumpers.
        </li>
        <li>

          <strong>Eddie the Eagle Rule</strong> - Following the widespread attention that Edwards received in Calgary shortly after the Olympics finished, the entry requirements were made stricter, making it nearly impossible for anyone to follow his example
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>1992</strong> - Edwards failed to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, or the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Norway. He got a five-year sponsorship from Eagle Airlines, a small British charter company, to support his attempt to reach the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan, but failed to qualify for those as well.


        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2008</strong> - On 13 February 2008, Edwards made a return visit to Calgary to take part in festivities marking the twentieth anniversary of the Games.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2010</strong> - Edwards was chosen as a torchbearer in the relay for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. He ran with the torch on 7 January 2010 in Winnipeg.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2012</strong> - On 25 February 2012, he appeared as a competitor on episode 2 of BBC1's Let's Dance for Sport Relief, 2012 and got through to the final on most public votes. 
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2016</strong> - In 2016, he was portrayed by Taron Egerton and Tom and Jack Costello in the biographical film Eddie the Eagle.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2017</strong> - In 2017, he returned to the ski jumping facilities at Canada Olympic Park, where he had taken part in the Olympics in 1988, to make some jumps that were his first in over 15 years
        </li>

          "They said I was afraid of heights. But I was doing sixty jumps a day then, which is hardly something someone who was afraid of heights would do"
